            \item \emph{\textbf{Project:} TCP Acceleration as a Service in Virtualized Environments}

                In this project, I explored the needs for network virtualization in public cloud 
                environment. The goal of the project is to enable modern, CPU efficient 
                network stacks for cloud tenants while enforcing isolation. To this end, 
                I added a netdev driver to Open vSwitch code and used TAS as an efficient
                packet processing stack for TCP.

            \item \emph{\textbf{Project:} Exploring Domain-Specific Architectures 
                for Network Protocol Processing} 

                        As part of this project, I worked with 
                Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA-based NICs. I implemented a userspace driver for 
                the PCIe communication using vfio driver.

    \begin{itemize}
       \item \emph{\textbf{Project:} 
	Towards Practical, Efficient, and Realizable Hardware-Software Interfaces to Enhance Application Expressivity} 

	This work investigates the possibility of designing rich hardware-software interfaces. As part of the project,
    I added custom instructions to RISC-V, and implemented a custom module on Rocket Chip which 
    can be used by programmers to convey high-level data structures to the underlying hardware.

    \begin{itemize}
       \item \emph{\textbf{Project:} SSD Reliability Under Adverse Condition }

            This project focuses on the behavior of Solid-State Disks (SSDs) under power fault. 
            I made an automatic failure testing framework, which consists of hardware and software 
            sections. By applying the testing framework, we tested more than 5 SSDs from different
            vendors and detected different types of data failures and device failure.
       \item \emph{\textbf{Project}: New Scheme for SSD Storage Caching} 


            In this project, I applied modification to caching mechanism of EnhanceIO code in 
            order to implement our new scheme of SSD storage caching. EnhanceIO is a dynamic 
            block level cache to improve the performance of rotating hard disk drives by using SSDs as cache devices.
